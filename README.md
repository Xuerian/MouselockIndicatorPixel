MouselockIndicatorPixel
=======================

NOTE: This functionality should be part of WildStar itself and not done through addons, as it treads near problematic areas

CARBINE: Adding a "Alternate actions during mouselock" checkbox and two keybind fields is all that is needed to replace this, allowing users to define a different action to perform in "combat mode"

Wildstar addon partner for WildstarMouselockRebind script

Displays a patch of color in the top-left of the screen indicating the return status of GameLib.IsMouseLockOn()

Does nothing without https://github.com/Xuerian/WildstarMouselockRebind
